# New Discord Badge - Completed a Quest

## IMPORTANT!
Discord added additional requirements after the exploit gained popularity and made some higher-level api changes, breaking many scripts that weren't robust. However, since this script communicates with the Discord API directly, it survived. Despite this, the new requirements still need to be fulfilled. These requirements include using the Discord desktop or PTB app and streaming to another account.


1.  Go to User Settings -> Gift Inventory and accept the quest.
    
2.  Join a voice channel.
    
3.  Start streaming any window, such as Notepad.
    
4.  Open the Developer Tools:
    
    *   If using the Discord desktop app, press Ctrl+Shift+I. If the Developer Tools don't open, try using Discord in a web browser instead.
    *   If using Discord in a web browser:
        *   For Chrome or Firefox, press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I
        *   For Safari, go to Preferences -> Advanced and check "Show Develop menu in menu bar". Then, click Develop -> Show Web Inspector.
5.  Navigate to the `Console` tab.
    
6.  Type `allow pasting` to enable pasting in the console.
    
7.  Copy and paste the provided code into the console and press Enter:
    

```js
let wpRequire;
window.webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[ Math.random() ], {}, (req) => { wpRequire = req; }]);

let api = Object.values(wpRequire.c).find(x => x?.exports?.getAPIBaseURL).exports.HTTP;
let ApplicationStreamingStore = Object.values(wpRequire.c).find(x => x?.exports?.default?.getStreamerActiveStreamMetadata).exports.default;
let QuestsStore = Object.values(wpRequire.c).find(x => x?.exports?.default?.getQuest).exports.default;
let encodeStreamKey = Object.values(wpRequire.c).find(x => x?.exports?.encodeStreamKey).exports.encodeStreamKey;
let sleep = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

let quest = [...QuestsStore.quests.values()].find(x => x.userStatus?.enrolledAt && !x.userStatus?.completedAt)
if(!quest) {
	console.log("You don't have any uncompleted quests!")
} else {
	let streamId = encodeStreamKey(ApplicationStreamingStore.getCurrentUserActiveStream())
	let secondsNeeded = quest.config.streamDurationRequirementMinutes * 60
	let heartbeat = async function() {
		console.log("Completing quest", quest.config.messages.gameTitle, "-", quest.config.messages.questName)
		while(true) {
			let res = await api.post({url: `/quests/${quest.id}/heartbeat`, body: {stream_key: streamId}})
			let progress = res.body.stream_progress_seconds
			
			console.log(`Quest progress: ${progress}/${secondsNeeded}`)
			
			if(progress >= secondsNeeded) break;
			await sleep(30 * 1000)
		}
		
		console.log("Quest completed!")
	}
	heartbeat()
}
```

8.  Keep the stream running for 15 minutes.
    
9.  Once the quest is completed, you can claim the reward by going to User Settings -> Gift Inventory.
    

Monitoring Progress:
--------------------

To track the progress of the quest:

*   Check the `Quest progress:` messages in the Console tab.
*   Reopen the Gift Inventory tab in User Settings to see the updated progress.

The progress should update every 30 seconds.

Note: You don't need any viewers watching your stream for this script to work. You can be alone in the voice channel.
